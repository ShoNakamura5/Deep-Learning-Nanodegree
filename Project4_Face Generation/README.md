# Face_Generation

In this project, I defined and train a DCGAN on a dataset of faces. This project is part of the [deep learning nanodegree program at udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101).   

# Overview 
The project is broken down into a series of tasks from loading in data to defining and training adversarial networks. And visualize the results of trained Generator generated samples that look like fairly realistic faces with small amounts of noise.
The model is trained on the CelebFaces Attributes Dataset (CelebA):

It generates new human faces that look like this(epochs=5):

# Dataset
I used the CelebFaces Attributes [Dataset (CelebA)](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html) to train adversarial networks.
